# üßπ clean-up

**A GitHub Action to automate the cleanup of stale branches in your repositories.**

This action identifies and deletes local Git branches that have been removed from the remote, helping maintain a tidy and up-to-date translation repository.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Basic example

To integrate the `clean-up` action into your workflow, add the following to your `.github/workflows/clean_up.yml` file.
Here is an example for the numpy.org translations repo.

```yaml
name: Clean Up

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 3 * * 0" # Runs every Sunday at 3 AM
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Clean up
        uses: Scientific-Python-Translations/clean-up@main
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        with:
          # Provided by user
          translations-repo: "Scientific-Python-Translations/numpy.org-translations"
          translations-ref: "main"
          # Provided by organization secrets
          gpg-private-key: ${{ secrets.GPG_PRIVATE_KEY }}
          passphrase: ${{ secrets.PASSPHRASE }}
          token: "not-a-real-token"
          crowdin-token: ${{ secrets.CROWDIN_TOKEN }}
```

This configuration schedules the cleanup to run weekly and also allows manual triggering.
